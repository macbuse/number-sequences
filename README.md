# Number Sequences

This started as a conversation about Vsauce:

1. Choose a language
1. x_0 is the number of characters in the word for 1
2. x_{n+1}  is the number oc characters in the word for x_{n}

##Example

In English this goes:

3, 5, 4, 4, 4......

one-->3-->three-->5-->five-->4-->four-->4-->four-->
